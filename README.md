# Binary turtle graphics
The program is to read instructions from a binary file and then modify the bmp file. The turtle has three attributes: a location, a direction, and a pen. The pen has attributes color, up/down. The first two bits of 16/32 bits commands define one of four 
commands 
* set position
* set direction
* move
* set up/down
 
## Result

The result of running the instructions in the file on a clean bmp file is output.bmp
